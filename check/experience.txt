It was 3rd August,2023 when I stepped into this college IIT Patna.Everytime, when I am so excited unexpected things are permanent.This time I was eating in boys mess for 2 days until mess worker told me that this is not girls mess.
What an awkward situation was that!
I always tries to create unforgottable memories.
On 4th of August after struggling a lot due to online registation and without eating whole day, finally I realised how important the backend is!
If I were known to backend I would have not struggled that day rather enjoying our meal in room or even better place.
So...
I was feeling being at home until my PAPA took off for home.It was the time when I felt bored and alone in my room.Then Dhanno came in my mind, it is my new cycle.In this way I got a new friend until I didn't met my batchmates.
This journey of making new friends with different backgrounds, cultures and area of interest get started.
Orientation sessions were all good if we had listened carefully.
After sleeping whole day in lecturesespecially of maths I came to know about no prerequesites of Nebula Dance performance. This way I enjoyed with the team exusia and our batchmates also. 
The only thing as a north indian hurts is, we rarely listen such songs on D.J. whose meaning can be interpreted.
But I have learnt now who to dance on tuning without understanding the lyrics.
So it was my first month at IIT Patna.
However it was adventures for me to explore a new place. I enjoyed a lot.
